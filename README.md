The content of the project was to analyze all the tables from AdventureWorks2022 Dataset by combining them and creating one or more new tables.
The project consists of three parts

 ## 1. I worked on data about company employees. I looked at their analysis by gender. I looked at the distribution according to the position.
According to the date of birth, their position in the organization was not left out. I have considered the granting of sick leave in several places
And I also looked at whether he was married or not. Because it is important in this work. All the mentioned information is very important in the work process of the employee.

## 2. In the second part, they will talk about goods for production or goods that are bought and sold. The price of the product will definitely affect the color.
Because someone may like a blue product, and someone may like a black product. It is clear that the main part of the products is blue and silver.
But when we look at the most expensive ones, black goods stand out. This may be due to the high cost and high demand for black paint.
There was one information that interested me, in which I looked at the dependence of the weight of the product on its volume. I found that they are inversely proportional to each other. This is really surprising news.
Then I saw the prices of the goods through its costs. In this case, they are proportional. Of course it's good. Next, I saw the price of the product by its weight in "Key Influencers".
In doing so, he brought out the best and worst results. He only considered his weight.
 
## 3. Will be added later.
